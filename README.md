In this project, I've worked on how to create a standard Machine Learning workflow from start to end.
I've build a machine learning model to accurately predicts whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

I've followed [Jerry Kurata's course on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-understanding-machine-learning/table-of-content).


# Dataset

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
